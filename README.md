# Abstract
This research introduces a novel approach
to semantic indexing and retrieval leveraging quantum
amplitude encoding. The methodology begins with query
decomposition, breaking down a primary user query into
targeted sub-queries to retrieve relevant search results from
DuckDuckGo, stored as context-rich document chunks.
Drawing inspiration from Quantum Semantic Field Theory,
each chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional,
quantum-inspired embedding using amplitude encoding
to capture nuanced semantic features. A physics-inspired
ranking mechanism is then employed, treating the query as
a wavepacket that propagates through the semantic field of
document chunk wavefunctions. The semantic relevance is
quantified by the squared overlap between the query and
document wavefunctions, prioritizing chunks with the highest
resonance. The top relevant documents are subsequently
indexed and ranked, culminating in the representation of
the search results within a knowledge graph. This innovative
approach demonstrates a sophisticated semantic search
solution that moves beyond traditional keyword matching by
applying principles of quantum mechanics to text embeddings
